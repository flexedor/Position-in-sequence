# Position-in-sequence
Write and use a function (iterative or recursive) which finds a given element in the monotonically increasing 
OR decreasing sequence of (signed) integers. The function should return the index of the found element,
or −1 if it doesn’t exist in the sequence.
(Indices in the sequence should be counted starting from 0)
Input
First line: m - number of test scenarios.
Next, for each test scenario, in consecutive lines:
n - number of elements in the sequence
the sequence itself (n numbers separated by spaces)
p - number of elements to be found
k0, ..., kp-1 - p elements to be found in the sequence.
Output
One line for each of p elements to be found for each of n test scenarios:
the index of the given element ki in the sequence, or -1 if ki was not found in the sequence.
